This project is split from my QTHmap and spotting network filter projects to make
publicly available models / load scripts for working with the data the FCC publishes
(specifically on amateur radio operators, possibly other data sets as well eventually)

It includes en, hd and am models (en = entity, hd = header, am = amateur) representing
the three major datasets in the amateur service license download available from the
Universal Licensing Service here:
http://wireless.fcc.gov/uls/index.htm?job=transaction&page=weekly

example_project is included as a reference if necessary, but you should only need to add
`fccdata` to INSTALLED_APPS, syncdb (or migrate via South), and then you're ready to store the data.

The import_hams management command will open, parse and save into the DB the pipe-delimited .DAT files you downloaded from the FCC and specified with the --path= command line argument.
